# RDR2Rant
A test for my data analysis class. Below are the steps I should follow to sucessfully do my pre-course work.
1. Create a new repository.
2. Copy the link.
3. In the terminal, cd into the directory where you want your repo to live.
4. Clone the repo: git clone <repo name>
5. cd into the repo.
6. Add a file.
7. Stage the changes in your current working directory: git add .
8. Commit the changes: git commit -m "some message"
  Blame all screw ups on Micah.
